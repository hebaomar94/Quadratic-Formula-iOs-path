# Quadratic-Formula-iOs-path
In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:
+bx+c=0
Graphing the quadratic equation will create a parabola like the one below:

Graph

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

Write a Swift program in Quadratic.swift that solves the quadratic equation for the xâ€˜s:
